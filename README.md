This is a v0.3 of Commit, an onchain accountability protocol.

## Commit to something

Personal commitments and goals often fail due to lack of real stakes and accountability. Traditional accountability methods (apps, coaches, groups) suffer from:

- Low engagement due to minimal consequences
- Manual verification and trust issues
- Limited financial incentives for commitment creators and platforms
- No standardized infrastructure for accountability

## It's time to Commit

Commit protocol provides blockchain infrastructure for stake-based accountability, enabling any platform or individual to create and manage commits (commitment challenges) where participants have real financial stakes in their success.
